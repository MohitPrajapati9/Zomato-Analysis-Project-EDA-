# Zomato-Analysis-Project-EDA

📊 About This Project
This project is an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of Zomato's restaurant dataset. The goal is to uncover trends and patterns that explain what makes a restaurant successful in terms of customer ratings and popularity.

Using Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, I analyzed key features such as:

📍 City-wise distribution of restaurants

⭐ Restaurant rating patterns and averages

💸 Relationship between price range and ratings

🍽️ Most common and popular cuisines

🏢 Top restaurant chains by number of outlets

The project includes data cleaning, handling missing values, removing duplicates, visualizing key insights, and drawing conclusions that can help restaurant businesses and food startups make better decisions.
